# cli-cps
Provides a way to interact with the Akamai Certificate Provisioning System (CPS) via Open APIs. Provides various functionality such as viewing certificate details, generating audits, checking/acknowledging change statuses, creating/modifying certificates, and working with third party certificates.

## Local Install
* Python 3+
* pip install edgegrid-python

### Credentials
In order to use this module, you need to:
* Set up your credential files as described in the [authorization](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Prov_Creds.html) and [credentials](https://developer.akamai.com/introduction/Conf_Client.html) sections of the getting started guide on developer.akamai.com.  
* When working through this process you need to give your API credential the "CPS" and "Contracts-API_Contracts" Grant.
* By default it uses "default" section from .edgerc file.
* To use different section from your .edgerc file pass `--section <name>`. E.g. for `cps` section pass `--section cps`.

```
[cps]
client_secret = [CLIENT_SECRET]
host = [HOST]
access_token = [ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]
client_token = [CLIENT_TOKEN_HERE]
```


## Functionality
Here is a summary of the current functionality:
* List current enrollments
* Generate an audit
* Retrieve enrollment details in yaml or json format
* Retrieve actual certificate details for what is deployed on the platform
* Create an enrollment from a yaml or json file
* Update an enrollment from a yaml or json file
* Cancel pending enrollment changes
* Delete live enrollments from Network
* View and verify current change status
* Acknowledge pre/post verification warnings
* Acknowledge change management
* Work with 3rd party certificates (download/upload signed csr)

### setup
Does a one time download of CPS enrollments and common names for faster local retrieval. This command can be run anytime and will refresh the /setup folder based on the current list of enrollments.

```bash
%  akamai cps setup
```

### list
List all current enrollments in Akamai CPS

```bash
%  akamai cps list
%  akamai cps list --show-expiration
```

(--show-expiration takes a little longer as fetches production expiration date)

### retrieve-enrollment
Get specific details for an enrollment and outputs the details in raw json or yaml format. Please specify either --cn or --enrollment-id

```bash
%  akamai cps retrieve-enrollment --cn sample.customer.com
%  akamai cps retrieve-enrollment --enrollment-id 12345
%  akamai cps retrieve-enrollment --cn sample.customer.com --json
%  akamai cps retrieve-enrollment --cn sample.customer.com --yaml
```

Here are the flags of interest (please specify either --cn or --enrollment-id):

```
--cn <value>                 Common name (CN) of the enrollment
--enrollment-id <value>      Enrollment id
--json                       Output in json format (Optional: will be default if nothing specified)
--yaml                       Output in yaml format (Optional)

```

### retrieve-deployed
Get specific details for the actual certificate deployed on the Akamai platform, including leaf, chain, or summary information. Please specify either --cn or --enrollment-id and one of --leaf, --chain, or --info arguments.

```bash
%  akamai cps retrieve-deployed --cn sample.customer.com --info
%  akamai cps retrieve-deployed --enrollment-id 12345 --info --network staging
%  akamai cps retrieve-deployed --cn sample.customer.com --leaf --network production
%  akamai cps retrieve-deployed --cn sample.customer.com --chain --network staging
```

Here are the flags of interest (please specify either --cn or --enrollment-id):

```
--cn <value>                 Common name (CN) of the enrollment
--enrollment-id <value>      Enrollment id
--leaf                       Leaf certificate details
--chain                      Full chain certificate details
--info                       Summary information about deployed certificate
--network                    Either staging or production (optional: default is production)
```


### status
Get current change status for an enrollment.

```bash
%  akamai cps status --cn sample.customer.com
%  akamai cps status --enrollment-id 12345
%  akamai cps status --enrollment-id 12345 --validation-type http (use if certificate type is DV)
%  akamai cps status --cn sample.customer.com --validation-type dns (use is certificate type is DV)
```

Here are the flags of interest (please specify either --cn or --enrollment-id):

```
--cn <value>                 Common name (CN) of the enrollment
--enrollment-id <value>      Enrollment id
--validation-type            Specify either 'http' or 'dns' (for DV certificates)
```

**If certificate type is third-party and CSR is ready, you may use this command to output the csr directly to a file:
```bash
%  akamai cps status --cn sample-cn.example.com > file.csr
```

### audit
Generate an audit of all enrollments to a .xlsx, .csv, or .json file
By default it generates report in csv format.
Use --xlsx for xlsx Format
Use --include-change-details to include current pending certificate details.
```bash
%  akamai cps audit
%  akamai cps audit --json
%  akamai cps audit --csv
%  akamai cps audit --xslx
%  akamai cps audit --output-file sample.xlsx
%  akamai cps audit --output-file sample.xlsx --include-change-details
